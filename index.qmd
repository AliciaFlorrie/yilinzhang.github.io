::: {#hero-heading}

Yilin Zhang is a Master‚Äôs student specializing in artificial intelligence, with a focus on large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and multimodal applications. She holds a Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Northeastern University, China, where she graduated in the top 20% of her program. Her academic excellence has continued into her graduate studies, with current rankings placing her in the top 10% of her cohort.

During her 2024‚Äì2025 summer research internship at the College of William & Mary under the supervision of Dr. Yanfu Zhang(https://yaz91.github.io/), she developed innovative AI solutions for healthcare challenges. Her work included designing a self-guided graph neural network (GNN) integrated with LLMs for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease analysis, resulting in an SCI-submitted paper. She also applied multi-armed bandit algorithms to optimize therapeutic decision-making for central nervous system aspergillosis, with findings submitted for publication.

At Northeastern University‚Äôs AI Lab, advised by Prof. Dongyue Chen(http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/chendongyue/zh_CN/index.htm), she led the development and deployment of an AI Teaching Assistant system, now actively used by students to enhance learning efficiency. Her technical expertise spans PyTorch, RAG, and LLM fine-tuning, with a proven ability to translate research into practical tools.

Committed to advancing AI‚Äôs societal impact, Yilin combines strong analytical skills, initiative, and a collaborative mindset‚Äîqualities reflected in her academic and research achievements. She is eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects in industry or academia.
